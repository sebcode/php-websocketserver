WebSocket Protocol implementation written in PHP

This is a very basic and unfinished implementation of the WebSocket
Protocol RFC 6455 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).

This server doesn't handle the TCP socket stuff, it just reads and
writes from STDIN/STDOUT, so you need to use a super-server like
xinetd or netcat.
